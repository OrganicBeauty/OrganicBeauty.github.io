        <p>For shiny, healthy hair natural and organic hair oil treatments are an absolute must. The best clean hair oils act as deep treatments to help seal split ends, tame frizz, prevent breakage and grow longer, thicker hair. Everyone from ancient royalty to indigenous tribes have practiced the ritual of hair oiling using the finest ingredients from nature. In today’s modern world there’s no shortage of clean beauty brands making pre-blended, clinically researched organic hair oils for growth. </p>
        
        <p>Hair oils are crucial for shiny, healthy locks, and even help with hair loss and thinning concerns. While hair needs both hydration and moisturization, in this post we’re focusing on products that provide intense moisturizing benefits. I’ve battled damaged, chemically-proceed hair for most of my life, during which I’ve been making DIY hair oils and using tons of clean hair oil products. I’m sharing the best clean and natural hair oils for dry, frizzy and <a href="how to minimize damage to hair.html">damaged hair</a>. Softer, healthier and shinier hair awaits.        </p>

        <h4>Coconut Oil</h4>
        <p>Coconut oil is often said to be the best oil to use on your hair to reduce protein loss and keep it looking healthy.

            Given the current popularity of coconut oil, this would be easy to dismiss as a trend.
            
            However, there is some evidence behind this claim.
            
            One older study published in 2003 examined the effects of applying coconut, sunflower, or mineral oil to hair before or after washing (3Trusted Source).
            
            To see which oil was best for protecting hair health, the researchers measured the amount of protein the hair lost after each of these treatments.
            
            They found that coconut oil was better at preventing protein loss than both the mineral and sunflower oils when applied either before or after the hair was washed.</p>
    
    <h4>Rosemary Oil</h4>
    <p>Rosemary essential oil is a common variety you can purchase and use as a home remedy. The oil’s health uses range from antioxidant benefits and anti-inflammation to memory enhancement and more.

        In recent years, there have been claims that the oil may be great for hair growth. Some say it could even prevent hair loss, pointing to Mediterranean cultures’ use of rosemary in hair rinses to promote hair growth for hundreds of years as supporting evidence.</p>
        
    <h4>Tea Tree Oil</h4>
    <p>Tea tree oil is an essential oil that has many benefits for the skin and hair.  Tea tree’s natural antiseptic and anti-inflammatory actions make it one of the most beneficial oils that should included as part of your daily hair and skin routine.
        If you’re in the process of growing your hair out, you might want to consider adding tea tree oil into your hair care routine.  Tea tree oil helps to unclog hair follicles and nourish your roots.
        If you’ve noticed flakes in your hair, use tea tree oil to tackle that dryness.  It moisturizes and soothes the scalp, reducing itchiness and making it less prone to flaking.
        Tea tree oil has proven natural antifungal and antibacterial properties that help in maintaining a clean, healthy scalp and strong, healthy hair follicles.

        <img class="blogs-img"src="images/collagen.jpeg" alt="Image">
        <p>Collagen is a protein that serves as one of the main building blocks for your bones, skin, hair, muscles, tendons, and ligaments.</p>
            <p>"Collagen is what keeps our skin from sagging, giving us that plump, youthful look," says dermatologist Dr. Ohara Aivaz.</p>
            
    <p> Your body naturally makes collagen, but this production decreases with age.
    </p>
            
    <p> "Starting in our mid-20s, we slowly begin to lose collagen," Dr. Aivaz says. "For women, we can lose up to 30% of it's production in the first 5 years of menopause."
        Because we lose collagen as we age, many are using collagen supplements as part of an anti-aging beauty regimen.</p>
        <p>Dermatologist suggest collagen supplements along with topical creams and peels sessions</p>
     <h4>  Diminish wrinkles and fine lines</h4>

<p>Exposure to the sun, pollution, poor health choices, and aging can all cause it's levels to decrease in the skin. When collagen levels decrease, fine lines and wrinkles start making an appearance around your mouth and eyes. Wrinkles and sagging skin are caused by agining hence collagen products and supplements can help prevent these signs of aging and keep your skin supple and smooth for longer.</p>

<h4>Minimize scars</h4>
<p>Collagenâ€™s amino acids can also help minimize the appearance of dark spots and scars from acne or other skin issues. Collagen supplements have been found to promote healthy tissue formation, which speeds up the healing process so your skin can naturally repair itself.Main reason for scar formations on skin is due to acne.In order to prevent and reduce acne you should check out<a href="dietacne.html">acne causing food</a> in your diet.</p> 

<h4>Firm and tone skin</h4>
<p>While creams and other skin products containing collagen help improve the outer layer of skin in improving elasticity, it's supplements will increase collagen on a deeper level (in the dermis). The dermis is responsible for keeping skin tight and firm, so the more collagen that reaches this level, the better your skin will look. <a href="dullskin.html">Dull skin</a>is often a result of loosing collagen in the skin. Age spots caused due to lack of applying sunscreen can also be improved with the help of collagen supplements to give even complexion.</p>

<h4>Moisturize</h4>
<p>The loss of collagen due to aging or environmental factors can leave your skin feeling dry and flaky. By adding it back into your skin, you can give your skin the hydration it needs to maintain a smooth, soft, healthy skin.</p>

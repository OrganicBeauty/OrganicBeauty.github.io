        <img class="blogs-img"src="images/collagen.jpeg" alt="Image">
        <p>"Collagen is a protein that plays a vital role as a fundamental component in the formation of bones, skin, hair, muscles, tendons, and ligaments," explains Dr. Ohara Aivaz, a dermatologist.</p> <p>"It is responsible for maintaining the firmness of our skin, contributing to a youthful appearance."</p>
            
    <p> Your body naturally makes collagen, but this production decreases with age.
    </p>
            
    <p> "According to Dr. Aivaz, the gradual decline in collagen production starts in our mid-20s. In the case of women, there can be a reduction of up to 30% in collagen production within the initial 5 years of menopause. This loss of collagen with age has led to the adoption of collagen supplements as a component of anti-aging beauty routines by many."</p>
        <p>Dermatologist suggest collagen supplements along with topical creams and peels sessions</p>
     
       <h4>  Diminish wrinkles and fine lines</h4>
<p>"Sun exposure, pollution, unhealthy lifestyle choices, and the natural aging process can all contribute to a reduction in skin collagen levels. When collagen levels decline, fine lines and wrinkles become more noticeable, particularly around the mouth and eyes. Since wrinkles and sagging skin are predominantly associated with aging, collagen-based products and supplements are utilized to mitigate these signs of aging, thereby promoting prolonged skin suppleness and smoothness."</p>

<h4>Minimize scars</h4>
<p>"The amino acids found in collagen can also play a role in reducing the visibility of dark spots and scars resulting from acne or other skin concerns. Collagen supplements have been shown to support the development of healthy tissue, expediting the healing process and enabling the skin to naturally rejuvenate itself. Acne is a primary factor contributing to scar formation on the skin. To prevent and alleviate acne, it's advisable to examine the impact of <a href="dietacne.html">acne-inducing foods</a> in your diet."</p> 

<h4>Firm and tone skin</h4>
<p>"While creams and various skincare products enriched with collagen are beneficial for enhancing the elasticity of the skin's outer layer, collagen supplements work to increase collagen production at a deeper level, specifically within the dermis. The dermis is accountable for maintaining skin's tautness and firmness, making a higher influx of collagen to this layer synonymous with improved skin appearance. <a href="dullskin.html">Dull skin</a> frequently stems from a loss of collagen in the skin, and age spots, often induced by inadequate sunscreen protection, can also be ameliorated through the use of collagen supplements, resulting in a more even complexion."</p>

<h4>Moisturize</h4>
<p>"The reduction in collagen, whether due to the aging process or environmental influences, can lead to skin that feels dry and prone to flakiness. Reintroducing collagen into your skin can provide the necessary moisture to sustain a smooth, soft, and overall healthy complexion."</p>

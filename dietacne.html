        <img class="blogs-img"src="images/food.jpeg" alt="Image">
        <p>The role of specific foods, such as dairy products, along with certain dietary patterns, may be a potential cause of acne and acne outbreaks.</p>

            <p>When it comes to diet and acne, foods that quickly raise your blood sugar (also known as high glycaemic foods), as well as dairy, may play a role in the development of acne.</p>
            
        <p>Foods that are rich in sugar, simple carbohydrates such as strach and dairy may increase the amount of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Having an excess of this hormone in your blood can cause your oil glands to produce more sebum, which will lead to acne and inflammation.</p>
            
    <p> Researchers 1 believe IGF-1 also causes an increase in the hormones dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone. These hormones bind to receptors in the skin and lead to your sebaceous glands expanding and producing more oil, which plays a role in the development of acne.</p>
            
    <p> Foods that cause blood sugar to rise rapidly include sugar, pasta, white bread, cereal and white rice.

     <h3>  What foods to avoid with acne</h3>

<p>While many of us grew up hearing how greasy junk foods could wreak havoc on our complexions (“oily food equals oily face”), the science shows it isn’t so simple. Several foods have the potential to trigger breakouts for a variety of reasons. If you suspect your diet may be contributing to your blemishes, consider taking a closer look at your consumption of these foods.</p>

<h4>Milk and dairy products</h4>
<p>Several studies over the years have indicated the negative impact of dairy on your skin. Theories include the idea that milk proteins may trigger hormones and growth factors in the body that increase your likelihood of developing acne (Dall’Oglio, 2021).  

Studies show that consuming any dairy (full-fat dairy, whole milk, low-fat/skim milk, yogurt), regardless of how much or how often, is associated with a higher chance of developing acne than those who don’t eat or drink any dairy products. However, most research indicates associations between dairy and acne, not a direct causal relationship—it’s not yet clear whether milk is a definite acne trigger for most people (Juhl, 2018).</p> 

<h4>High-glycemic foods</h4>
<p>The glycemic index (GI) measures how much carbohydrate-rich foods impact blood sugar levels. High-GI foods are typically (but not always) processed or refined forms of carbs, like white bread, white rice, sugary cereals, snack foods, and more. 
Diet containing sugar could be a cause for insulin resistance. 
These high-GI foods cause a spike in your blood sugar and insulin levels (Holesh, 2021). These spikes may, in turn, trigger factors (like insulin-like growth factor 1—IGF-1) and pathways in your body that make acne more likely to develop. On top of that, the rapid rise in blood sugar levels can also lead to inflammation, which can make your acne worse (Dall’Oglio, 2021; Berbudi, 2020). </p>
<h4>Chocolate</h4>
<p>No one wants to entertain arguments against the consumption of chocolate, but it has been a long-suspected acne trigger. Some studies suggest that people who eat chocolate have a higher likelihood of worsening their acne. But scientists don’t know if this is because chocolate, like other sugary foods, has a high glycemic index or if other factors are at play (Dall’Oglio, 2021; Baldwin, 2021). 

Dark chocolate also has antioxidants that may help with acne. In short, there is no proven causal relationship between chocolate and acne, and more research is needed in this area.</p>
<h4>Fatty foods</h4>
<p>It’s no surprise that oily, fatty foods are suspected of making acne worse. Research suggests that eating fried food, oily food, fast food, etc., worsens acne.Processed food can lead to high blood glucose levels that is not easily digested by the body causing acne. One theory is that saturated fats and trans fatty acids may trigger increased IGF-1 levels and acne development (Baldwin, 2021; Dall’Oglio, 2021).

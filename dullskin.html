            <h4>What Causes Dull Skin?</h4>
<p>In order to solve a problem, you need to know what’s causing it. You can’t get glowing skin without first tackling dull skin.

    There are many reasons your skin could be looking dull and less than fresh:
    
    Uneven skin tone
    Dry skin
    Excess dirt and oil
    Dehydration
    Lack of sleep
    Sun damage
    Aging
    Smoking
    Stress
    </p>
    <p>Dull skin could also be the result of acne,oily skin, open pores,black heads and dead skin cells.Likewise over exfoliation and using the wrong skin-care products could also cause your skin to look dull.</p>

<h4>What Makes Your Skin Glow?</h4>
<p>The good news is that dull skin doesn’t have to be permanent, and there are lifestyle choices you can make to brighten the look of your skin. Some of them will not only lead to healthier skin, but a healthier you as well.</p>
    <p>Drinking water - This one may be obvious, but most of us still aren’t drinking enough water. Water keeps you and your skin hydrated and flushes toxins from your system. An adult needs about eight 8 oz. glasses of water each day to stay hydrated.</p>
    <p>Eating right - Eating foods rich in antioxidants help protect your skin from environmental stressors that cause damage. Foods like blueberries, spinach, kale, raspberries, and cacao are all full of antioxidants and quite delectable!. Getting enough hydration is also important for healthy skin.</p>
    <p>Reducing sun exposure - The sun can cause major damage to your skin if you don’t protect it. When you’re out in the sun, wear a hat and sunscreen, and try to stay in the shade as much as possible.</p>
    <p>Getting Sleep - As tempting as it is to stay up late binging Netflix, an irregular sleep schedule can wreak havoc on your skin and make it look dull and lifeless. Aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep each night</p>    </p>
    
    <h4>How To Make Your Skin Glow and Brighten Dull Skin</h4>
<p>Lifestyle choices aren’t the only things that can brighten dull skin. The right skincare routine can make the ultimate difference in achieving a radiant complexion. Here’s our tips for the ultimate glow skincare routine:

    First, let’s start with a basic routine that pretty much everyone should follow:</p>
<p>Cleanser - Excess dirt and oil are two major causes of dull skin. Wash your face in the morning and at night, and choose a cleanser that’s right for your skin type.</p>
<p>Toner - This is a step that’s often overlooked, but a gentle toner that doesn’t contain alcohol can help to refresh, balance, and hydrate your skin – all of which will help brighten your complexion. Toners are especially beneficial for people with oily or combination skin, as they help to balance natural oils, so you can get the glow without the shine.</p>
<p>Vitamin C Serum - Vitamin C is one of the best ingredients for reducing the look of dark spots, resulting in brighter skin. Daily use will keep your skin refreshed and glowing.</p>
<p>Sunscreen - Be sure to wear a moisturizing sunscreen everyday, with a minimum rating of SPF 30 – even if it’s cloudy. Sun exposure can lead to dry, dull skin, wrinkles, and dark spots.</p>
<p>In addition you can also try face masks and balanced exfoliation for youtful skin. </p>

            <p>The skin, which is considered to be the largest organ, consists of three layers: epidermis, or the surface layer, dermis, or the middle layer, and hypodermis, or the deep layer. Collagen and elastin proteins are made in the middle layer, which consists of the connective tissues of the skin that are responsible for its elasticity. Thus, it is the collagen and elastin fibers that cause the skin to return to its original position when it is stretched. It should be noted that due to several factors such as aging, the rate of production of these fibers and proteins decreases; as a result, the elasticity of the skin decreases and our skin becomes loose and droopy.</p>
            
     <h4>What Causes Skin to Lose Its Elasticity?</h4>
<p>The loss of skin elasticity stems from a variety of factors but maintaining healthy habits and an overall healthy lifestyle can help optimize elasticity levels as we naturally age. Levels of both collagen and elastin decline with age7. However, if you are wondering, “what age does skin lose elasticity?”, it’s important to note that age isn’t the only reason. Along with age, other factors can also accelerate the breakdown of these two proteins.</p>

<h4>UV RAYS (SUN EXPOSURE)</h4>
<p>Solar elastosis is the breakdown of elastin resulting from sun exposure or other sources of UV rays8. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), sun damage is one of the most preventable causes of crepey skin 9. UV rays age your skin, whether the source is the sun or a tanning bed. Long-term exposure to UV degrades elastin and collagen, damages skin cells, and impairs the skin’s ability to heal itself.UV rays cause various skin problems,so it is important to take <a href="sunprotection.html">preventive measures</a> to have good looking skin in the long term.</p> 

<h4>SMOKING</h4>
<p>Research also shows that the skin of 30-year-old smokers already shows creasing and lines typically only seen in the skin of non-smokers who are 40 or over10. Another research study found a correlation between skin elasticity and lung function in smokers. Because smoking breaks down collagen and elastin and causes inflammation, skin aging may be a sign of reduced lung function in smokers11. As it turns out, poor skin elasticity in smokers may be a strong indication of impaired lung function. </p>

<h4>HORMONAL CHANGES</h4>
<p>Hormonal changes can significantly impact the appearance of your skin. During menopause, for example, the rapid drop in estrogen levels causes a reduction in collagen. Studies show that in the first five years after menopause, about 30% of collagen is lost12. Some medical conditions and medications can also cause rapid hormonal changes, which may disrupt the body’s collagen levels. Without sufficient levels of collagen, skin becomes wrinkled and less elastic.</p>
     


<h4>How Can I Increase My Skin Elastin?</h4>
<p>Increasing your skin’s elastin content is possible. Some women turn to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to fight against the body’s loss of estrogen and counter the effects of menopause, like collagen and elastin declines, bone loss, and hot flashes. However, HRT is still not considered completely risk-free by some physicians, leading many to opt out of this treatment.</p>

<p>Laser treatments, often conducted in a physician or licensed esthetician’s office, can improve elasticity and encourage collagen production. Two of the most commonly-used laser treatments – non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) and intense pulsed light therapy – are same-day treatments. Though effective, these aging skin treatments are costly and, sometimes, painful.</p> 

<p>Skin topicals can be effective at improving skin tightening and smoothness. They’re also a much less invasive option than laser or hormone treatments. However, not all topicals are the same. Although many skin care topicals claim to increase elastin and improve skin firmness, some don’t contain effective ingredients, and if they do, many don’t penetrate deep enough into the skin to encourage elastin and <a href="collagen.html">collagen</a> production. Because these proteins exist in large amounts beneath the first layer of skin, penetrating into the deeper skin layers is essential.</p>

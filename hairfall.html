            <p>Many people are troubled by hair breakage and split ends, but often don't know how to do it properly. But what are the reasons for these problems? Let us share with you the reasons are methods to protect your hair from breakage and split ends</p>
            

<h4>Reasons for hair breakage and split ends </h4>
<p>For split ends, it can be said that the tip of the hair splits like a tree branch. The ends can split into a V shape or even from the center . As for hair breakage, the hair breaks from the middle portions. Unlike hair loss, hair that breaks near the roots is a sign of severe damage. Reasons for these problems will be shared below</p>

<h4> Damage to the hair.</h4>
<p>UV Rays, Heat, Static electricity are some of the causes of damage. By wearing a hat outdoors during summer, you can prevent direct sun rays from reaching your head.Sometimes oily scalp and hair products residue can cause hair damage. Also, if you use a low heat setting on your dryer, you can reduce the risk of Split ends and Hair Breakage. Perhaps a less known reason is static electricity. When you use styling products, especially those made of plastic or nylon, the friction can easily cause static to occur. And that is also one of the causes of Hair Breakage and Split Ends.In order to understand <a href="how to minimize damage to hair.html">how to minimize hair damage</a> check out our blog!</p>

<h4>Insufficient Nutrients to the hair</h4>
<p>On the surface of each hair strand, there are cuticles similar to fish scales lined up. When there is insufficient vitamins and nutrients, the cuticles are unable to function properly and the hair becomes weak. Nutrients for the hair depends on the food we eat and having insuffecient meals can lead to our hair not receiving enough nutrients. Thus leading to hair breakage and split ends. <a href="probiotics for hair growth.html">Probiotics</a> can help with gaining essential nutrients to your hair.</p>

<h4>Ways to prevent hair breakage and split ends</h4>
<p>Hair breakage and split ends can be a result of variety of factors such as: not using the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair type, Brushing your hair while it's still dry, using too many heat styling tools, not using hair masks, etc. </p>

<h4>Partially air-dry your hair</h4>
<p>The first steps in our haircare routine can affect the health of our ends. Rough drying involves using heat, which can dry out strands and lead to splitting. So if you really want to protect the hair, Steve Robinson, Art Director at the Electric Hair Group, recommends air drying until strands are 50-80% dry and then using a hairdryer to create shape and smooth the cuticles.

    "Make sure you apply a good moisturising cream," he says. "It’s also really important to understand how to blow-dry properly. You should never touch the nozzle to the hair directly – instead position it just above the hair and brush."

    <h4>Dial down the temperature of styling tools</h4>
    <p>"Any hair tool over 180 degrees will de-keratinise the hair," says Steve. "Healthy hair contains keratin, which dissipates when it's heated over 200 degrees. Once this process happens, it’s impossible to replace the keratin."

        Steve also says it’s a huge myth that the hotter your straighteners or curling wand, the better and longer lasting your blow-dry or curl.Also blow-dry your hair in down ward direction to avoid frizz.</p>
        

<h4>Don't pick at split ends</h4>
<p>Picking at your spots only makes them worse and the same is true of picking at split ends. Peeling back and snapping off a split end only disturbs the hair cuticle even more, leading to another split end and so on.

    “The point where the hair stops splitting is where the weak hair ends and strong hair begins," says Steve, "so this will give you an indication of how much to have cut off."

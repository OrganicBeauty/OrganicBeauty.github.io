            <p>"Hair breakage and split ends can be a source of concern for many individuals, and often, they are unsure of the correct approach to address these issues. So, what are the causes behind these problems? Allow us to elucidate both the reasons and methods to safeguard your hair from breakage and split ends."</p>
            

<h4>Reasons for hair breakage and split ends </h4>
<p>"When it comes to split ends, it's akin to the hair's tip dividing, resembling the branches of a tree. These splits can form a V shape or even originate from the center. In the case of hair breakage, it occurs within the midsections of the hair. Unlike hair loss, breakage near the roots indicates significant damage. We will delve into the causes of these issues shortly."</p>

<h4> Damage to the hair.</h4>
<p>"Damage to your hair can be attributed to various factors, including UV rays, heat, and static electricity. Protecting your head from direct sun exposure by wearing a hat outdoors during the summer can shield your hair from harmful UV rays. Additionally, hair damage can be caused by an oily scalp and residue from hair products. Using a low heat setting on your hair dryer is another effective way to reduce the risk of developing split ends and experiencing hair breakage. An often overlooked factor is static electricity, which can be generated when using styling products, especially those constructed from plastic or nylon materials. This friction can contribute to both hair breakage and split ends. To learn more about how to minimize hair damage, please visit our blog at <a href="how to minimize damage to hair.html">this link</a>."</p>

<h4>Insufficient Nutrients to the hair</h4>
<p>"Each individual hair strand possesses cuticles that resemble fish scales, forming a protective layer on the surface. When there is a lack of essential vitamins and nutrients, these cuticles struggle to fulfill their role, resulting in weakened hair. The nourishment our hair receives is directly influenced by our dietary choices, and a deficiency in meals can result in inadequate nourishment for our hair. Consequently, this deficiency can lead to issues such as hair breakage and split ends. <a href="probiotics for hair growth.html">Probiotics</a> can be beneficial in supplying your hair with the vital nutrients it needs."</p>

<h4>Ways to prevent hair breakage and split ends</h4>
<p>"The occurrence of hair breakage and split ends can be attributed to a range of factors, including: using an inappropriate shampoo and conditioner for your specific hair type, brushing your hair when it's dry, excessive use of heat styling tools, and neglecting to use hair masks, among other factors."</p>

<h4>Partially air-dry your hair</h4>
<p>The first steps in our haircare routine can affect the health of our ends. Rough drying involves using heat, which can dry out strands and lead to splitting. So if you really want to protect the hair, Steve Robinson, Art Director at the Electric Hair Group, recommends air drying until strands are 50-80% dry and then using a hairdryer to create shape and smooth the cuticles.

  "Make sure you apply a good moisturising cream," he says. "It’s also really important to understand how to blow-dry properly. You should never touch the nozzle to the hair directly – instead position it just above the hair and brush.</p>

    <h4>Dial down the temperature of styling tools</h4>
    <p>"Any hair tool over 180 degrees will de-keratinise the hair," says Steve. "Healthy hair contains keratin, which dissipates when it's heated over 200 degrees. Once this process happens, it’s impossible to replace the keratin."

        Steve also says it’s a huge myth that the hotter your straighteners or curling wand, the better and longer lasting your blow-dry or curl.Also blow-dry your hair in down ward direction to avoid frizz.</p>
        

<h4>Don't pick at split ends</h4>
<p>Picking at your spots only makes them worse and the same is true of picking at split ends. Peeling back and snapping off a split end only disturbs the hair cuticle even more, leading to another split end and so on.

    “The point where the hair stops splitting is where the weak hair ends and strong hair begins," says Steve, "so this will give you an indication of how much to have cut off."

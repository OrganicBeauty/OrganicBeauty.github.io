            <p>Do you feel like you need to shampoo every single day because your hair just gets too dirty and greasy? And somehow, your hair still feels dry? We hate to break this to you, but your shampoo could be to blame.

                Traditional shampoos often contain a lot of questionable ingredients: sulfates, parabens, silicones, fillers — the list goes on and on. If your hair is in a tizzy and you can’t figure out why, it may be time to make the switch to a gentle shampoo bar. 
                
                What makes our shampoo bars the best option for fussy hair, you ask? Allow us to break it down: </p>
            
<p>According to celebrity hairstylist Ken Paves better known for his work on David Beckham also warns against the use of shampoo daily. Paves who has also worked with stars like Jennifer Lopez and Jessica Simpson recommends washing your hair two to three times a week.</p>
<p>Skipping shampoo daily does not mean you should avoid washing your hair for too long. Washing less not only makes your hair untidy, greasy, and stinky but also results in an excessive build-up of oils in the scalp. The excessive oils in the scalp lead to an overgrowth of yeast naturally found on the skin resulting in dandruff.</p>
<p>Besides dandruff, the excess oils in the scalp also aggravate hair loss as these oils can trap DHT in the hair follicles of the scalp. DHT or Dihydrotestosterone is the hormone responsible for male pattern baldness</p>
<h4>How often should you wash your hair?</h4>
Everyone’s hair is different. Washing every day might work for some people, while washing once or twice a week may be better for others. In general, the thickness of your hair and the amount of oil your scalp produces are good indicators of how often you should be lathering up. Here are some general guidelines you can follow:
<ul>
<li>For fine, thin, or oily hair: shampoo every day or every other day.</li>
<li>For medium-thick or dry hair: wash your hair every 2-3 days.</li>
<li>For thick or curly hair: wash your hair 1-2 times a week.</li>
</ul>
<h4> It also depends on your lifestyle.</h4>
<p>
  Working out a lot and sweating can make your hair dirtier faster. If you use a lot of products in your hair, it might get greasier faster than if you didn’t. Living in a highly polluted area can even cause your hair to get dirtier in between washes.[12] All of these things may mean you need to wash your hair more frequently. While your hair type definitely matters, experiment with how regularly you wash your hair to find what works best for your lifestyle.
  You may have heard that shampooing less frequently will cause your scalp to produce less oil, but that’s actually a myth! Oil production is controlled by your hormones, not how regularly you wash your hair.[13]</p>

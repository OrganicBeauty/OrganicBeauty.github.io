        <p>Damaged hair comes in many forms - rough or straw-like texture, split ends, frizz, breakage, etc. If you are experiencing any of these you know it can be frustrating as well as difficult to style.        </p>

        <h4>Reduce The Temperature Of Your Styling Tools</h4>
        <p>Your flat iron, curling iron, and blow dryer are the magic wands that change your unruly hair into luscious curls and waves. However, this same wand comes with dryness and brittleness. One common mistake is setting the temperature too high when styling with heat causes the most damage.</p>

        <h4>Shampoo Wisely & Properly</h4>
        <p>The use of certain shampoo brands also affects your hair health. Choose a sulfate-free shampoo produced for damaged hair like the Goldie Locks Ultra-Hydrating Signature Shampoo. Stick to shampoos that contain natural ingredients that will assist in repairing your damaged hair.

            In addition, avoid frequent shampooing and use dry shampoo if your scalp and hair need refreshing on the second or third day of your last wet wash. Rinse your hair with lukewarm and finish up with cold water to finish the shampooing process.</p>
    
            <h4>Indulge In Quality & Healing Hair Masks</h4>
    <p>Hair masks are the ultimate secret to conditioning and repairing damaged hair. They contain high concentrations of moisturizing and reparative ingredients such as oils, vitamins, and naturally-sourced components. Masks are thick, nutritious hair mixtures that penetrate deeply into the hair surface.    </p>
       
    <h4>Handle Wet Hair With Care</h4>
    <p>All hair is at its most vulnerable when wet, and the possibility of damage increases if your wet hair is curly, fine, or fragile. Do not try to pull a brush through your wet hair, except the brush was made explicitly for that task. Many professionals recommend using a wide-tooth comb for detangling.

        In addition, when you leave the shower, skip vigorous rubbing, and instead, carefully blot your hair with a fluffy towel, a soft cotton t-shirt, or a microfiber cloth. Using this helps you prevent friction that can put tension on vulnerable hair. Avoid securing your hair with an elastic band when wet, as it can also cause breakage.

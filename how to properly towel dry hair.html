        <p>"Towel drying can be advantageous when done correctly. The key is to use a gentle microfiber hair towel. Conventional towels, due to their rough texture, can easily cause hair tangling."</p>
         <p>"After completing your hair wash, softly squeeze out any excess water, starting from the scalp and working your way down to the tips. Your hair should be damp but not dripping wet. Then, take a portion of your hair and delicately pat it with a towel.

          Remember, the key is to avoid rubbing your hair and, instead, use a gentle squeezing motion."</p>  
         <p>"After you've finished drying each section of your hair, you have the option to repeat the process if necessary. While it's not obligatory, if you have long hair or if your hair still feels damp, you might consider doing this step again."</p>
         <p>"For those with thick, long, and curly hair that tends to retain moisture, you can experiment with the 'hair wrapping' method for drying. To employ this technique, you'll need a larger, soft towel that can adequately cover and wrap around your hair."</p>
         <p>"After washing your hair, softly remove excess water by gently squeezing it. Then, bend over, allowing your hair to fall forward, hanging down. Lay a towel over your hair, ensuring that the towel's edge aligns with the bottom of your hair. Commence twisting the towel starting as close to your forehead as you can. Finally, flip the twisted end over the top of your head.

          You can leave your hair wrapped in this way for approximately 20 minutes."</p>

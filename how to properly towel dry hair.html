        <p>Towel drying can be beneficial if you know how to do it right. All you need is a soft microfiber hair towel. Remember, regular towels are rough and course and tend to tangle hair badly.</p>
         <p>Once you finish washing your hair, gently squeeze out excess water, starting from the scalp and moving towards the ends. Your hair will still be damp, but it shouldn't be dripping wet. Next, gather a section of your hair and gently blot it with a towel.

            The trick is never to rub your hair, instead gently squeeze it.</p>  
         <p>Once you finish drying all sections of your hair, you can repeat the process once more. This is not a mandatory step, but if you have long hair or if you feel your hair is still not dry enough, you may want to repeat this step.</p>
         <p>If you have thick, long, curly hair that holds on to the water for a long time, you can try the 'wrapping your hair' technique to dry your hair. This technique requires a larger towel than blotting - it has to be soft and big enough to wrap your hair</p>
         <p>When you finish washing your hair, gently squeeze out excess water. Next, bend over and flip your hair forward, so it hangs straight down. Place a towel over your hair, so the bottom of the hair and the towel are in line. Twist the towel by starting as close to your forehead as possible. Flip the end of the twist on top of your head.

            You can leave your hair in the wrap for about 20 minutes.</p>

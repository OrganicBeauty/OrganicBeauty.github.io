            <p>Melasma is a skin condition characterized by patches of brown, tan, and blue-gray

                Melasma
                skin discoloration, and it’s most often seen in women in the middle of their reproductive years. Melasma is a form of facial pigmentation, and it’s typically found in three different areas of the face: the jawline, the central part of the face, and the cheekbones. Many people will notice melasma on the bridge of their nose, chin, and forehead, but it may appear on other areas of the body, including the neck, chest, or arms—any patch of skin that sees the sun a lot.</p>

<h4>Are There Different Types of Melasma?</h4>
<p>Yes. There are three types of melasma diagnoses: epidermal, dermal, and mixed.</p>
<p>Epidermal: This type is characterized by dark brown patches with a well-defined border. This type of melasma typically responds very well to treatment, and is more readily apparent under black light.
    Dermal: This type is characterized by light brown or bluish patches with a less-defined border. This type doesn’t respond very well to treatment, and its appearance doesn’t changed under a black light.
    Mixed: This is the most common type of melasma diagnosed, and is characterized by a combination of light and dark brown patches and bluish discoloration. This type is relatively responsive to treatment.</p>

    <h4>How Do I Treat Melasma?</h4>
<p>Wear sunscreen every day: One of the best ways to treat and prevent melasma is with proper sun protection. Because sun exposure triggers this skin condition, you must wear sunscreen every day, whether it’s sunny or overcast. Always opt for sunscreens with broad-spectrum protection, and be sure to reapply at least every two hours. If you plan to go swimming or do an activity that causes heavy sweating, reapply sunscreen more frequently.</p>
<p>Wear protective clothing: Sunscreen is priority number one, but you can increase your sun protection by adding a wide-brimmed hat, baseball cap, and layered clothing to your wardrobe.</p>
<p>Don Some Shades: Throw on a pair of sunglasses to shield the sensitive skin around your eyes, but make sure you’ve selected the right style. Avoid sunglasses metal rims; these can attract heat, and when placed against your skin, make melasma worse.</p>
<p>Don’t wax: Try not to wax, as this can cause immediate skin inflammation that can make melasma worse.</p>

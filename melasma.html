            <p>"Melasma, a skin condition, presents as a form of skin discoloration primarily affecting women during their reproductive years, often associated with hormonal fluctuations in the body. This pigmentation issue typically manifests in three distinct facial regions: the jawline, central facial area, and cheekbones. Many individuals may observe melasma on the bridge of their nose, chin, and forehead; however, it can also appear on other sun-exposed areas of the body, including the neck, chest, or arms. Excessive sun exposure, tanning, or sunburn can stimulate the body to produce increased pigmentation in response to the strong UV rays encountered by our skin cells."</p>

<h4>Are There Different Types of Melasma?</h4>
<p>"Yes, there are three distinct types of melasma diagnoses:</p>
<p>Epidermal: This type is distinguished by the presence of dark brown patches with well-defined borders. Epidermal melasma indicates that the pigment is located in the more superficial layers of the skin. It typically exhibits a favorable response to treatment and becomes more evident under black light.</p>
    <p>Dermal: In this type, you'll notice light brown or bluish patches with less-defined borders. Dermal melasma resides in the deeper layers of the skin. Unfortunately, it does not typically respond well to treatment, and its appearance remains unchanged under black light.</p>
    <p>Mixed: This is the most commonly diagnosed form of melasma and is characterized by a combination of both light and dark brown patches along with bluish discoloration. Mixed-type melasma is relatively responsive to treatment."    </p>

    <h4>How Do I Treat Melasma?</h4>
<p>Wear sunscreen every day: One of the best ways to treat and prevent melasma is with proper sun protection. Because sun exposure triggers this skin condition, you must wear sunscreen every day, whether it’s sunny or overcast. Always opt for sunscreens with broad-spectrum protection, and be sure to reapply at least every two hours. If you plan to go swimming or do an activity that causes heavy sweating, reapply sunscreen more frequently.Dermatologist believe that not applying enough spf could lead to the pigment become darker.</p>
<p>Wear protective clothing: Sunscreen is priority number one, but you can increase your sun protection by adding a wide-brimmed hat, baseball cap, and layered clothing to your wardrobe.</p>
<p>Don Some Shades: Throw on a pair of sunglasses to shield the sensitive skin around your eyes, but make sure you’ve selected the right style. Avoid sunglasses metal rims; these can attract heat, and when placed against your skin, make melasma worse.</p>
<p>Try following a skincare routine designed by dermatologist to reduce hyperpigmentation and age spots. They may suggest topical treatments, peels or cosmetic procedures to improve this skin condition.</p>
<p>Avoid treatments that could cause post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.</p>
<p>Target increased melanocytes with lightening creams like hydroquinone.</p>
<p>Don’t wax: Try not to wax, as this can cause immediate skin inflammation that can make melasma worse.</p>

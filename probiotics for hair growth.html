            <p>When you think of probiotics, or bifidobacterium, the first thing that might come to mind is yogurt and kimchi. You’ve probably seen a few probiotic supplement options on the shelves, too - and these are a great way to get the good bacteria our bodies need to function.</p>
            
<p>What many people don't realize is that probiotics not only have health benefits for your internal health - addressing ailments including ulcerative colitis and symptoms of Crohn's Disease - but can also benefit the health of your hair and skin. In fact, topical probiotics can help address skin issues, hair loss, candida, dandruff, and other concerns. Here's what you should know about these handy bacteria.</p>
<p>Probiotics are simply ‘healthy’ live bacteria like Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Saccharomyces boulardii (all names you might find on the labels of probiotic products).The question is "Can probiotics improve skin health". Probiotic skin treatments deliver live, active bacteria that can help improve your skin’s health. This may sound odd, but the truth is that our skin barrier stops these microbes from going any further than they should and allows them to bring our skin back into balance. This may help resolve the issues that cause itchy skin, and excessive dead skin cells. </p>
<p>So does the use of probiotics really help improve your skin health and fight dandruff? The answer is complex. Some evidence suggests that probiotics are helpful in reducing dandruff. One study, for instance, found that dandruff improved more in a group of otherwise healthy volunteers who took probiotics than in a control group. It’s important to note, however, that this research is fairly preliminary and more data is needed before healthcare providers will begin recommending probiotics as a first-line response to dandruff.</p>
<h4>What Are the Benefits of Probiotics on Hair?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Provide Thick and Shiny Hair: Studies have shown that probiotics have an influence in increasing the number of cells on the scalp and so provide thick hair, and they also add shine to the hair.</li>
<li>Balances Hormone Levels: As we know, changes in hormone levels also contribute to hair loss. Hormones such as estrogen and progesterone are the hormones responsible for hair growth. It is also the thyroid hormones that are responsible for normal metabolic functions and hair growth. So if the individual suffers from a thyroid disorder, it can lead to a decline in estrogen and progesterone levels, thereby leading to hair loss. So to be exact, probiotics promote hair growth by maintaining a balance in these hormone levels.</li>
<li>Stops Hair Loss: Probiotics inhibit hair loss by reducing inflammation and stress levels. It promotes the sustainable growth of the hair follicles and has anti-inflammatory properties, thereby producing hormones to disrupt the inflammatory cycle. Usually, increased stress levels lead to hair loss because any traumatic event leads the hair follicles to shift from the growing phase to the shedding phase, thus leading to hair loss. However, recovery to your hair growth phase occurs after five to six months; there is an instant idea of taking probiotics that help to balance the stress and anxiety levels, thereby reducing hair loss.</li>
<li>Facilitates Proper Digestion: Unhealthy hair is a sign of poor digestion. We know that hair is made up of protein. The protein is gained through the diet. But if the protein is taken excessively, it can turn into a toxic product that has to be digested. Unfortunately, if it is not digested properly, it can lead to the malabsorption of nutrients. Thus probiotics have a role in regulating the stomach acids to digest the diet and absorb nutrients and finally nourish the hair.</li>

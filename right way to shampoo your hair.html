            <p>It should be so simple: Squirt some hydrating shampoo into your palm, work it into your hair until it’s a rich luxurious froth, and rinse. But somewhere along the way, things got a bit complicated. Co-washes, second-day stylers, dry shampoo—there are more products than ever designed to help you lather up less. But is that a good thing? There are so many ways to wash, but only one correct way to learn how to shampoo your hair. </p>
            <h4>Follow these steps on your hair wash day</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Detangle</li>
              <p>Before wetting your hair, gently run a wide-tooth comb through it. If your hair is tangled when you start washing, it is likely to get more knotted. Start at your ends and gradually work your way up to the root to avoid snarling and breakage. We suggest using a ‘saw-cut’ comb in which each tooth is cut into it, making it smoother - they are available in plastic or vulcanite (hard rubber). Avoid cheap plastic combs made from a mould as these can cut into your hair. Metal combs are even worse as their edges can lacerate your hair.</p>
            <li>Pre-Soaking</li>
            <p>Pre-soaking your hair is very important. If you wet your hair thoroughly, you will need less shampoo, and applying too much shampoo can cause your hair to look dull and is also a waste of product. Use warm water to wet your hair and gently draw your fingers through it.</p>
            <li>Applying your Shampoo and Lathering</li>
          <p>Do not pour shampoo directly onto your hair. Instead, pour it onto the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and then smooth the shampoo over your hair. Gently rub your palms over your hair, and massage your scalp with your fingertips in a gentle kneading motion. Massage on any part of your body is relaxing and gives you a feeling of well-being - this is particularly so in scalp massage and shampooing.

            Continue the massaging action for approximately 30 seconds and every so often run your fingers through your hair from front to back in order to avoid tangling. One wash is all that is needed if you wash your hair daily. It is not necessary or healthy for you to vigorously rub your scalp. This can sometimes lead you to pull out and break your hair, and can also irritate your scalp.
            
            </p>
            <li>Rinse</li>
            <p>A common cause of dull hair is insufficient rinsing out of shampoo. We suggest that even if you think you have rinsed enough, you should rinse again. There is no reason to finish off your rinse with cold water, unless you enjoy it. A ‘cold rinse’ does not in fact make your hair shinier; it is conditioning which does this.Try out our reccomended <a href="products.html">products</a> for good hair days experience.

          </ul>
            <p>Certified trichologist Sophia Emmanuel isn’t so sure: “You have to understand that, despite their names, co-washes and dry shampoo do not cleanse your hair the way regular shampoo will,” she says. They should be used sparingly—and only in conjunction with a traditional shampoo.</p> 
            <p>But a once-a-day wash isn’t necessarily appropriate for everyone—your washing schedule really depends upon your hair type, says celebrity stylist Mia Santiago, whose clients include Mariska Margitay, Martha Stewart, Christina Hendricks, and Dove Cameron. She recommends gauging your routine based on the thickness of your hair. </p>
            <p>Medium-to-thick types can get by with two to three washes per week and even those with texture type 4 hair should still wash at least once a week, says Emmanuel. “If you have a particularly oily scalp or use a lot of waxy or oil-based hair products, you may need to shampoo a bit more, no matter your hair type,” she explains.

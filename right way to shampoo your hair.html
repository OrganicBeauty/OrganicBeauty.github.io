            <p>"It should be straightforward: Dispense some moisturizing shampoo into your hand, lather it into your hair until it becomes a luxurious froth, and then rinse. However, somewhere along the line, things became more complex. Co-washes, second-day stylers, dry shampooâ€”there's now an abundance of products intended to reduce the need for traditional lathering. But is this complexity a positive development? While there are numerous hair-washing methods available, there remains only one correct way to learn how to shampoo your hair."</p>
            <h4>Follow these steps on your hair wash day</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Detangle</li>
              <p>"Before wetting your hair, gently glide a wide-tooth comb through it. If your hair is already tangled when you begin washing, it's more likely to become further knotted. Begin at the tips of your hair and gradually move upwards towards the roots to prevent tangling and breakage. We recommend using a 'saw-cut' comb, available in either plastic or vulcanite (hard rubber), as it has smoothly crafted teeth. It's best to avoid inexpensive plastic combs that are molded, as they can be harsh on your hair. Metal combs should also be avoided, as their edges can cause damage to your hair."</p>
            <li>Pre-Soaking</li>
            <p>"It's essential to pre-soak your hair. When you thoroughly wet your hair, you'll require less shampoo, and using too much shampoo can lead to dull-looking hair, as well as product wastage. Start by using warm water to saturate your hair and gently run your fingers through it."</p>
            <li>Applying your Shampoo and Lathering</li>
          <p>"Avoid pouring shampoo directly onto your hair. Instead, dispense it into the palm of your hand, rub your hands together, and then distribute the shampoo evenly over your hair. Gently massage your palms over your hair while using your fingertips in a gentle kneading motion to massage your scalp. The soothing effects of a massage are not only relaxing but also promote a sense of well-being. This is especially true when it comes to scalp massage during shampooing.

            Continue this massaging motion for approximately 30 seconds, occasionally running your fingers through your hair from front to back to prevent tangling. If you wash your hair daily, a single shampoo is typically sufficient. It's not necessary or healthy to vigorously rub your scalp, as this can lead to hair breakage and irritation of the scalp."
            </p>
            <li>Rinse</li>
            <p>"Inadequate rinsing of shampoo is a frequent cause of dull hair. We recommend that, even if you believe you've rinsed thoroughly, you give it another rinse. There's no necessity to conclude your rinse with cold water unless you find it enjoyable. Contrary to popular belief, a 'cold rinse' doesn't inherently enhance hair shine; it's conditioning that accomplishes this.

            </p>
          </ul>
            <p>Certified trichologist Sophia Emmanuel isn't entirely convinced: "It's important to realize that, despite their names, co-washes and dry shampoo don't cleanse your hair as effectively as regular shampoo," she explains. She advises using them sparingly and in conjunction with a traditional shampoo.</p>
<p>However, not everyone requires a daily hair wash. According to celebrity stylist Mia Santiago, whose clientele includes Mariska Margitay, Martha Stewart, Christina Hendricks, and Dove Cameron, the frequency of your hair washing routine depends on your hair type. She suggests tailoring your routine based on your hair's thickness.</p>
<p>For those with medium-to-thick hair, two to three washes per week may suffice, and even those with type 4 textured hair should aim for at least one weekly wash, as per Emmanuel's recommendation. Emmanuel also notes, "If you have an excessively oily scalp or frequently use waxy or oil-based hair products, you may find it necessary to shampoo more frequently, regardless of your hair type.</p>

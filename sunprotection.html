            <p>Though the sunlight hours have shortened since summer solstice in June, there’s still plenty of time for ample sun exposure. But excess sunlight (particularly its harmful UV rays) can lead to skin cancer, the most common — and most preventable — form of cancer in the U.S.

                Fair skin that burns easily, blue or green eyes, blonde or red hair, and older age are also some common risk factors for skin cancer and <a href="melasma.html">melasma</a>, but it can develop in people of any skin color.</p>
            
     <h4>Protection = Prevention</h4>

<h4>Shade</h4>
<p>Keeping out the most intense sunlight will protect your skin. Experts at the American Skin Association recommend going indoors or finding a shady spot during the brightest parts of day, which is usually between 10 AM and 2 PM.</p>

<h4>Sunscreen</h4>
<p>Even on cloudy days, harmful UV rays can bounce from water, glass, and sand surfaces to reach your skin. Making a habit of wearing sunblock year-round can be one of the best methods of protection.

    When choosing your sunscreen, The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends looking for broad spectrum coverage, with an SPF of 15 or higher. The MD Anderson Cancer Center meanwhile advises one with both UVA and UVB protection, and SPF 30 or higher.
    
    How much should you be using? The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends “the equivalent of a shot glass (two tablespoons) of sunscreen to the exposed areas of the face and body – a nickel-sized dollop to the face alone.” If your sunscreen comes in spray form, keep applying until you’ve got an even sheen.
    
    </p>

<h4>Clothes & Other Coverings</h4>
<p>Hats, sunglasses, swim shirts, and umbrellas can also provide significant protection.

    “Long-sleeved shirts, long pants, or long skirts cover the most skin and are the most protective,” according to the American Cancer Society. “Dark colors generally provide more protection than light colors. A tightly woven fabric protects better than loosely woven clothing. Dry fabric is generally more protective than wet fabric.”
    
    If you’re concerned about keeping cool while staying covered, Prevention provides guidance on how to choose sun-protective clothing that won’t interfere with summer fun. Clothes made from this type of fabric can keep you from having to reapply sunscreen, or leaving a hard-to-reach spot unprotected.

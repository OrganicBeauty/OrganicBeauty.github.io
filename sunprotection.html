            <p>"While the daylight hours have decreased since the summer solstice in June, there remains a substantial amount of time for extended sun exposure. Nevertheless, excessive sunlight, particularly its detrimental UV rays, can give rise to skin cancer, which happens to be the most prevalent and preventable type of cancer in the United States.
              Fair skin that is prone to sunburn, blue or green eyes, blonde or red hair, and advanced age are among the typical risk factors associated with both skin cancer and <a href="melasma.html">melasma</a>. Nonetheless, it's crucial to recognize that these conditions can also develop in individuals of any skin color."</p>
            
     <h4>Protection = Prevention</h4>
<p>"Prioritizing sun safety is paramount and requires proactive measures. Ultraviolet radiation can infiltrate the skin, triggering heightened melanin production. Therefore, it is essential to consistently apply sunscreen. Individuals with lighter skin tend to be more susceptible to sunburn, whereas those with medium to dark skin often tan more readily. Consequently, opting for a broad-spectrum sunscreen is advisable for comprehensive protection."</p>

<h4>Shade</h4>
<p>"Shielding your skin from the most intense sunlight is a crucial safeguard. The American Skin Association's experts advise seeking shelter indoors or locating a shaded area during the sun's peak intensity, typically occurring between 10 AM and 2 PM. It's important to note that UV light can penetrate through glass, underscoring the importance of applying sunscreen even when indoors."</p>

<h4>Sunscreen</h4>
<p>"Even on overcast days, it's important to remember that harmful UV rays can reflect off surfaces like water, glass, and sand, posing a risk to your skin. Establishing a routine of year-round sunscreen application can be one of the most effective protective measures.

  When selecting your sunscreen, The Skin Cancer Foundation suggests opting for one that offers broad-spectrum coverage with an SPF of 15 or higher. On the other hand, the MD Anderson Cancer Center recommends choosing a sunscreen with both UVA and UVB protection and an SPF of 30 or higher.
  
  As for the quantity you should use, The Skin Cancer Foundation advises applying 'the equivalent of a shot glass (two tablespoons) of sunscreen to the exposed areas of the face and body, with a nickel-sized dollop for the face alone.' If your sunscreen is in spray form, continue applying until you achieve an even and complete coverage."</p>

<h4>Clothes & Other Coverings</h4>
<p>"Hats, sunglasses, swim shirts, and umbrellas can all serve as substantial protective measures.

  The American Cancer Society suggests that garments like long-sleeved shirts, long pants, or long skirts offer the greatest coverage and protection for the skin. Dark-colored clothing typically provides more defense than lighter shades, and tightly woven fabrics offer superior protection compared to loosely woven materials. Dry fabric is generally more effective at safeguarding against the sun than wet fabric.
  
  If you're concerned about maintaining comfort while staying covered, Prevention offers guidance on selecting sun-protective clothing that doesn't impede summer enjoyment. Clothing crafted from such fabrics can eliminate the need for frequent sunscreen reapplication and ensure that hard-to-reach areas remain protected."</p>

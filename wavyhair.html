            <p>There are plenty of methods you can use to create natural waves in your hair. 

                Whether it's through a new hairstyle, or swapping some of your usual hair products, we've got 10 ways to get wavy hair for you to explore.</p>
            

<h4>Braids </h4>
<p>Braids are cute. And what makes them even cuter is their ability to take your hair and give it gorgeous waves overnight.

    You can use this method on both long hair and shorter styles and it’s absolutely perfect for post-hair-wash days when your hair needs that lift to keep it going strong.</p>

    <p>Work with freshly washed hair and begin by gently detangling it with your fingers and setting your desired parting.For this step check out <a href="right way to shampoo your hair.html">correct way to shampoo</a> your hair.</p>

        <p>2 Squeeze out any excess water.</p>
        
        <p>3 Apply a texturising spray like Shrub Sea Salt Texturising Spray*, to your wet hair and scrunch it in an upwards direction with a t-shirt or microfibre towel.</p>
        
        <p>*Not got a sea salt spray? We’ll tell you how to make your own below.

        Then scrunch with your hands for that tousled surfer babe look.</p>
        
         
        <p>5
        Section your hair into 2 and use the traditional braiding method – you know, the old ‘separate into three and keep crossing outer strands through the middle’ job.</p>
        
        <p>6
        Secure with a hairband as far down as you can while keeping the braids intact. If you have shorter hair you can secure short strands with a bobby pin.</p>
        
        <p> 7
        Once you’re happy with those pretty pigtail, give your hair a light spray all-over with a volume-enhancing hair spray like Jason Thin To Thick Extra Volume Hair Spray for lots of lift and a soft, long-lasting hold. This way your hair will stay put all day long while training your hair waves.</p>
        
        <p>8
        Simply leave them in overnight and let them do their magic! Clip the braids up into a bun just below the crown if you want more volume.</p>
        
        <p> 9
        When you get up in the morning, take out the hair bands (and clips if you used them) and separate and smooth the strands loose from each other with your fingers.</p>
        
        <p>10
        Make sure to twist any sticky-out bits and tuck them under your hair until you’re happy with your wavy style.</p>
        
        <p>11
        Spritz some more hairspray on before you leave the house to keep your hair beautifully wavy all day long.
        
        This method works even better if you keep the braids in right after you’ve washed it for 24+ hours, e.g. put the ‘work’ in on those lazy Sunday mornings for fabulous beachy waves come Monday morning.</p>
